# A Short course on UQ for CFD

Generalized polynomial chaos and stochastic collocation methods for uncertainty quantification in aerodynamics.

The maturity of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the variability of operational and geometrical parameters in fluid dynamics analysis and design lead to the development of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). Among the numerous methods for UQ, these lecture notes describe the main features of Monte-Carlo and metamodel-based Monte-Carlo, generalized Polynomial Chaos, and Stochastic Collocation. The broadly used sparse grid quadrature method of Smolyak is then outlined. Lastly some concepts of variance analysis are introduced. Two applications of UQ to 2D and 3D RANS flows, that have been carried out at, are finally presented.
